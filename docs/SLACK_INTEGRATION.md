# Slack Integration

Lets people fill in their week and see who's at Neal Street without leaving Slack. This doc covers what it does, where its credentials live, how to set it up from scratch (for a handover or a fresh workspace), and how to add new team members so they're picked up correctly.

## What it does

- **`/log-week` slash command** — opens a modal to fill in your week directly (Mon–Fri, one location per day, no morning/afternoon split — that's web-app-only). Re-running it pre-fills whatever you've already entered that week.
- **Quick-fill buttons** ("🔁 Same as last week" / "✏️ Fill in week") — shown in the daily reminder DM (a bot can't open a modal without a fresh interaction, so the DM needs a button first; the slash command skips straight to the modal since it already has one).
- **Daily reminder DM** — every weekday morning, anyone who hasn't filled in their week yet gets DMed the quick-fill buttons, addressed to them by name (`Hey @Name — ...`).
- **Daily Neal Street digest** — every weekday morning, a message goes to a configured channel listing who's at Neal Street that day, in the same day-by-day style as the week summary below (real @mentions, names on the line below the day label).
- **Tomorrow Neal Street digest** — every weekday afternoon (4pm London), a message goes to the same channel listing who's at Neal Street the next working day, in the same day-by-day style as the week summary below. Skipped on Fridays (tomorrow would be Saturday).
- **Next-week reminder DM** — every Friday afternoon (2pm London), anyone who hasn't yet entered *next* week's locations gets the same quick-fill buttons, reworded for next week. "Same as last week" here naturally means "same as this week", since it's relative to next week's Monday.
- **Week summary** — after successfully saving (via the modal or "Same as last week"), you privately get an Officely-style breakdown of who's at Neal Street each day that week, with a "See Full Schedule" link back to the web app.

## Architecture (brief)

- Backend: `backend/slack_routes.py` (the 5 HTTP endpoints), `backend/slack_views.py` (Block Kit message/modal building + parsing), `backend/slack_client.py` (thin Slack Web API wrapper + request signature verification), `backend/slack_directory.py` (matches `team-members.json` names against the Slack workspace directory), `backend/daily_notifications.py` (the scheduled jobs' logic).
- The 5 endpoints, all under `app.include_router(slack_router)` in `backend/app.py`:
  - `POST /slack/commands` — the `/log-week` slash command
  - `POST /slack/interactivity` — button clicks, modal field changes, and modal submission all come through here
  - `POST /internal/slack/daily-notifications` — the 9am scheduler trigger (gated by its own secret, see below); accepts an optional `?force=true` query param that bypasses the weekday/hour gate, for manual test runs
  - `POST /internal/slack/tomorrow-digest` — the 4pm scheduler trigger; same gating and `?force=true` behavior
  - `POST /internal/slack/next-week-reminder` — the Friday-2pm scheduler trigger; same gating and `?force=true` behavior
- Scheduling: `.github/workflows/slack-daily.yml` (9am digest + reminders), `.github/workflows/slack-tomorrow-digest.yml` (4pm tomorrow digest), and `.github/workflows/slack-next-week-reminder.yml` (Friday 2pm next-week reminder) — each a GitHub Actions cron firing at **both** UTC-equivalents of the target London hour (08:00/09:00, 15:00/16:00, and 13:00/14:00 UTC respectively). Each endpoint checks whether it's actually the target hour in London and no-ops on whichever firing doesn't match — this is deliberate, so the crons never need editing for BST/GMT. All three workflows also support manual "Run workflow" with a `force` checkbox to bypass the gate entirely.
- Testing without spamming the team: set `SLACK_TEST_MODE_USER_NAME` (a Slack real name, e.g. "Cam Doherty") in Render to redirect **every** outbound message — channel digests and DM reminders alike — to just that person. Unset it (blank the value in the Render dashboard) to go back to normal broadcast behavior.
- Identity: there are no Slack-specific accounts. A person's identity for Slack-submitted entries is resolved from their Slack profile's real name at submission time; for the *outbound* DM reminders, `team-members.json` names are matched against the Slack workspace directory (`users.list`) by normalized name — see "Adding a new team member" below.

## Credentials — where they live

All of these are **Render environment variables** (dashboard → the `api` service → **Environment** tab), except the last:

| Variable | What it's for | How it's set |
|---|---|---|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Auth for all outbound Slack API calls | Manually pasted from the Slack app's OAuth & Permissions page — **not** auto-generated, `render.yaml` just declares the key exists (`sync: false`) |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Verifies incoming requests really came from Slack | Same as above — manually pasted from the Slack app's Basic Information page |
| `SLACK_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID` | Which channel gets the daily Neal Street digests (today's at 9am, tomorrow's at 4pm) | Plain value in `render.yaml`, currently `C0BJV5KDT4P` |
| `SLACK_SCHEDULER_SECRET` | Gates the scheduler-trigger endpoints (separate from `ADMIN_SECRET`, to scope blast radius) | Auto-generated by Render (`generateValue: true`) |
| `SLACK_SCHEDULER_SECRET` (again) | The GitHub Actions workflows need the *same* value to call the endpoints | Copied manually from Render's dashboard into **GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** — Render and GitHub don't sync this automatically, so if it's ever regenerated on one side, it needs re-copying to the other |
| `SLACK_TEST_MODE_USER_NAME` | Optional: redirects every outbound message to just this one person for testing | Manually set/unset in Render dashboard (`sync: false`, blank by default) |

**Also relevant, not Slack-specific:** `ROSTER_URL`/`CLIENTS_URL` default to fetching `team-members.json`/`clients.json` from the live frontend (`in-office.vercel.app`) — no env var needed unless overriding. `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX` (in `backend/app.py`, not an env var by default) matches preview deployment URLs by the **Vercel project name** — if that project is ever renamed again, this needs updating too (see the comment right above it in the code, and `backend/tests/test_api.py::test_vercel_preview_cors_regex_matches_current_project_name`, which will start failing if it drifts).

## Ownership — what a handover needs to include

Unlike GitHub/Vercel/Render (tracked in `HANDOVER.md`), **the Slack app itself lives at api.slack.com/apps under whichever Slack account created it** — this repo has no record of which account that is. Before handing over ownership:

- [ ] Confirm who has admin access to the Slack app (api.slack.com/apps → the app → **Collaborators**, or ask a workspace admin) and add the new owner.
- [ ] Confirm the new owner has access to the Render dashboard (for `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`/`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`/`SLACK_SCHEDULER_SECRET`) and the GitHub repo's Actions secrets (for the copy of `SLACK_SCHEDULER_SECRET`) — both already covered by the existing GitHub/Render handover steps, just flagging that these particular secrets are Slack-specific and easy to overlook.
- [ ] If the Slack app needs to move to a different Slack workspace entirely (not just a different admin within the same workspace), it needs to be recreated from scratch there — see "Setting up from scratch" below.

## Adding a new team member

1. Add their name to `frontend/public/team-members.json` (keep the array alphabetically sorted, case-insensitive — see `CLAUDE.md`). Match it to their **Slack profile's Full Name** (Slack → their profile → this is what daily reminder matching compares against) — if it doesn't match, they won't get reminder DMs (they'd show up in `unmatched_roster_names` in the daily job's log, see Troubleshooting).
2. Nothing else is needed — `/log-week` works for anyone in the workspace immediately (it resolves identity directly from their Slack profile, not from the roster), and they'll start getting daily reminders once their name matches.

## Setting up from scratch (new workspace, or recreating the app)

1. Create a Slack app at **api.slack.com/apps** → "From scratch" → pick the workspace.
2. **OAuth & Permissions → Bot Token Scopes**: add `chat:write`, `users:read`, `im:write`.
3. **Install to Workspace** (same page) → copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`) → `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
4. **Basic Information → App Credentials → Signing Secret** → copy it → `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.
5. **Slash Commands → Create New Command**: `/log-week` (or any name, just workspace-unique), Request URL `https://api-a8uz.onrender.com/slack/commands`.
6. **Interactivity & Shortcuts** → toggle on, Request URL `https://api-a8uz.onrender.com/slack/interactivity`.
7. Invite the bot to whichever channel should get the daily digest, grab that channel's ID → `SLACK_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID`.
8. Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`/`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`/`SLACK_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID` in the Render dashboard (the `sync: false` entries in `render.yaml` are placeholders — Render won't fill them in for you).
9. After the next deploy, copy the Render-generated `SLACK_SCHEDULER_SECRET` into a GitHub Actions repo secret of the same name.
10. If you change scopes later, **reinstall the app to the workspace** (OAuth & Permissions → Reinstall) — Slack requires this for scope/feature changes to take effect, and skipping it is the most common cause of things silently not working.

## Troubleshooting

- **"/log-week is not a valid command"** — the app hasn't been reinstalled since the slash command was added. Reinstall (OAuth & Permissions → Reinstall to Workspace).
- **"App did not respond"** — either a cold Render instance (free tier sleeps after inactivity; try again a few seconds later), or a genuine bug in a handler that's taking >3s to ack. Check Render logs for what actually happened.
- **A message literally says `{}`** — this was a real bug (fixed): Slack's slash-command/block-actions contract needs a truly empty HTTP response to ack silently; returning `{}` as a JSON body could get rendered as a literal `{}`. If it recurs, check for a route returning `JSONResponse({})` where it should return `Response(status_code=200)`.
- **401 on every Slack request** — `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is missing, wrong, or has a stray whitespace/newline from copy-paste. `backend/slack_client.py`'s `verify_signature` logs the configured secret's length and whether it has surrounding whitespace (never the secret itself) on a mismatch — check Render's logs for that line.
- **Some people never get reminded / their name shows in `unmatched_roster_names`** — their `team-members.json` entry doesn't match their Slack profile's Full Name closely enough (exact match after trimming whitespace and lowercasing, no fuzzy matching). Fix either side to match the other.
- **A PR preview can't reach the API ("failed to fetch")** — the CORS regex (see Credentials section above) doesn't match the current Vercel project name. Check `backend/app.py`'s `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX` default against the actual preview URL shown in the PR's Vercel comment.
