## 🛠️ PM2 Commands

### Basic Management
```bash
# View status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs

# Restart all services
pm2 restart all

# Stop all services
pm2 stop all

# Start all services
pm2 start all
```

### Individual Service Management
```bash
# Restart just the API
pm2 restart work-tracker-api

# Restart just the frontend
pm2 restart work-tracker-frontend

# View logs for specific service
pm2 logs work-tracker-api
pm2 logs work-tracker-frontend
```

## 🔄 Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)

To make the services start automatically when your Mac boots up, run:

```bash
pm2 startup
```
This prints a `sudo ...` command tailored to your user and Node install — copy and run the line it outputs.

Then save the current configuration:
```bash
pm2 save
```

## 📁 Log Files
All logs are saved to the `logs/` directory at the project root.

## 🛑 Stopping Everything
```bash
pm2 stop all
pm2 delete all
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If services won't start:
```bash
# Check logs
pm2 logs

# Restart everything
pm2 restart all

# Or use the startup script (run from the project root)
./scripts/start.sh
```

### If you need to update the code:
The services will automatically restart when you make changes to the code (hot reload is enabled).

## 📊 Monitoring

# Real-time monitoring
